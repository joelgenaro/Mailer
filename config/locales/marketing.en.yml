          After spending 10 years based in Tokyo as an expat you accumulate a lot of correspondence which doesn’t go

      about:
        the_mailmate_story: "MailMate was founded with a simple idea in mind: make paper mail digital in Japan. We built a platform that allows anyone to manage paper mail in Japan online,  win back time and focus on the things that matter."
        how_it_began: "Founded in 2019, MailMate is a first-of-its-kind tech solution to Japanese mail, allowing users to access their local mail from anywhere in Japan, or the world. We felt your pain –– we’ve paid our own bills at the local convinience store and navigated scores of paperwork in our mailboxes (most of which was never relevant to begin with). Fast forward to today and we’ve built a solution: MailMate."
